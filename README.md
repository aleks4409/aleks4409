üëãHey there! Welcome to my GitHub repository. Here, you'll find a collection of my coding projects and experiments. Let me introduce myself and share some information about my programming journey.

//------------------------------------------------About Me-------------------------------//
üë®üèº‚ÄçüíªMy name is Aleks, and I am passionate about programming. I enjoy diving into the world of code and exploring different technologies. With each project, I strive to improve my skills.

//-------------------------------------------Programming Journey-------------------------//
üì±I'm currently focusing on mobile app development using Flutter. I find it fascinating to create cross-platform applications with a single codebase.

Additionally, I have experience in web development. I can build basic websites using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP. While I'm still a beginner in React.js.

Another area of interest for me is desktop application development. I can create simple desktop applications using C# and WinForms.

ü§ñMoreover, I have a keen interest in bot development. I enjoy using Python along with the Selenium library to build automation scripts and bots. It's satisfying to see how bots can streamline repetitive tasks and enhance productivity.

//------------------------------------------------Projects-------------------------------//
Here are some of the projects I have worked on or currently working on:

Flutter Quiz App: simple app where you do flutter quiz. 

React.js - To do list: a simple application that allows users to manage their daily tasks.

Python Selenium Fuel Price Scraping and Calculator Bot: The Fuel Price Scraping and Calculator Bot is designed to extract up-to-date fuel price information and automatically input it into a Google Sheets calculator, all while logged into the user's account. This solution eliminates the need for manual price updates,  for calculating transportation costs.

Please feel free to explore my GitHub repositories to find more exciting projects. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas. I'm always open to learning, sharing knowledge, and working on interesting projects with fellow developers.
